# KnownBase - Initial Requirements

## ðŸŽ¯ Product Vision

### Problem Statement
Development teams systematically accumulate technical knowledge that doesn't fit into formal documentation:
- **Known Issues**: Small bugs that can't be fixed immediately
- **Setup Steps**: Project-specific configuration procedures  
- **Technical Tips**: Team-specific workarounds and best practices
- **Tribal Knowledge**: Information passed verbally or lost in chat

**Current Pain Points:**
- Confluence/Notion: Overloaded, mixed with functional docs, outdated
- README files: Hard to search, often stale
- Slack/Teams: Knowledge gets lost in conversations
- **Result**: Wasted time, repeated questions, knowledge silos

### Solution
A dedicated SaaS platform for volatile technical knowledge, designed specifically for development teams. A searchable, collaborative, always-updated technical knowledge base.

### Long-term Vision  
The definitive Developer Handbook - dynamic, accessible, and intelligently organized.
